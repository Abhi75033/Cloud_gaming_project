# 🎮 Cloud Gaming Platform – README

## 📘 Overview
This project is a full-fledged **Cloud Gaming Platform** that allows users to play and spectate games directly through their browser — no installation required. Each game runs inside a GPU-enabled Docker container, streamed in real-time, with support for multiplayer and spectator modes.

---

## 🌐 Vision
Build a scalable, browser-accessible gaming platform where users can instantly launch, play, and watch games without installing anything locally.

---

## ⚖️ Objectives
- 🐳 Containerize games with GPU access using Docker.
- 🌐 Provide a browser-based client for streaming and input.
- ⚙️ Automate game session lifecycle: start, stop, and scale.
- 👾 Enable multiplayer with real-time input routing.
- 🎥 Add spectator mode using WebRTC and SFU.
