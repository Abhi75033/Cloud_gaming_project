# 🎮 Cloud Gaming Platform – README

> 🚀 A fully containerized, browser-based cloud gaming solution with support for multiplayer, spectators, and GPU acceleration — built using Docker, WebRTC, React, and AWS.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project is a full-stack **Cloud Gaming Platform** that allows users to **launch, play, and spectate games** directly from their browser — no installation required. Every game session runs inside a **GPU-powered Docker container** on the cloud and is streamed in real-time to the user.

---

## 🌐 Vision

🔮 Create a **scalable, browser-accessible cloud gaming ecosystem** that empowers users to play instantly and enables developers to innovate, collaborate, and deploy games without traditional limitations.

---

## ⚖️ Objectives

🎯 Key goals of this project:

- 🐳 Containerize GPU-accelerated games with Docker
- 🌐 Stream games to the browser via VNC/WebRTC
- ⚙️ Automate game session lifecycle (start, stop, scale)
- 🎮 Enable real-time multiplayer input handling
- 👀 Add spectator mode via WebRTC/SFU
- 📊 Support developer-friendly monitoring and debugging tools

### 🔹 Phase 2: Docker Game Containerization
- 🐳 Use `nvidia/opengl` base + install game
- 📺 Add `Xvfb` + `x11vnc`
- 🔧 Build & run:  
  `docker run --gpus all -p 6080:6080 game-image`

### 🔹 Phase 3: Backend API (Express.js)
- 🎯 Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/game/start`
  - `POST /api/game/stop`
  - `GET /api/game/list`
- 🛠️ Use `child_process.exec()` to manage containers

### 🔹 Phase 4: Frontend (React.js)
- 🧩 Build UI to list and launch games
- 🖥️ Embed `noVNC` or WebRTC viewer for gameplay

### 🔹 Phase 5: Input & Multiplayer
